# Azure Application Registration Management for VS Code
This extension provides a way to view and manage Azure Application Registrations from within Visual Studio Code.

## Notes
This extension was created both as a learning exercise, and to address the common annoyances of managing Application Registrations. It is not officially supported and you use it at your own risk.

It has a dependency on the Azure Tools extension pack, but only because it places the application registrations view into the Azure view container.

## Known Limitations
